## Project Descriptions
#### [P1: Movie Trailer](https://github.com/sharynneazhar/FSND-Movie-Trailers-P1)
You will write server-side code to store a list of your favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. You will then serve this data as a web page allowing visitors to review their movies and watch the trailers.

#### [P2: Build a Portfolio](https://github.com/sharynneazhar/FSND-Portfolio-P2)
You will be provided with a design mockup as a PDF-file and must replicate that design in HTML and CSS.

#### [P3: Multi User Blog](https://github.com/sharynneazhar/FSND-Blog-P3)
In this project you will be building a multi user blog(along the lines of Medium) where users can sign in and post blog posts as well as 'Like' and 'Comment' on other posts made on the blog. You will be hosting this blog on Google App Engine and you will also be creating an authentication system for users to be able to register and sign in and then create blog posts!

#### [P4: Tournament Results](https://github.com/sharynneazhar/FSND-Tournament-Database-P4)
You will develop a database schema to store the game matches between players. You will then write code to query this data and determine the winners of various games.

#### [P5: Item Catalog](https://github.com/sharynneazhar/FSND-Catalog-P5)
You will develop an application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories as well as provide a user registration and authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.

#### [P6: Neighborhood Map](https://github.com/sharynneazhar/FSND-Neighborhood-Map-P6)
You will develop a single-page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify popular locations or places youâ€™d like to visit, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations. You will then research and implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations (such as StreetView images, Wikipedia articles, Yelp reviews, etc).

#### [P7: Design a Game](https://github.com/sharynneazhar/FSND-Game-API-P7)
In this project you will use these skills to develop your own game! You will write an API with endpoints that will allow anyone to develop a front-end for your game. Since you aren't required to write a front-end you can use API explorer to test your API.

#### [P8: Linux Server Configuration](https://github.com/sharynneazhar/FSND-Linux-Server-P8)
You will take a baseline installation of a Linux distribution on a virtual machine and prepare it to host your web applications, to include installing updates, securing it from a number of attack vectors and installing/configuring web and database servers.
