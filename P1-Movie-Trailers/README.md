A project from Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree Program

#### Project Description
In this project you will build a Movie Trailer Website where users can see your favorite movies and watch the trailers. You'll be writing server side code to store a list of movie titles, box art, poster images, and movie trailer URLs. The data will then be expressed on the web page and allow users to review the movies and watch the trailers.

#### Objective
Learn how to write an application using object-oriented Python and how to make the application serve HTML via a web server
