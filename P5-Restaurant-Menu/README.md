A project from Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree Program

#### Project Description
You will develop an application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories as well as provide a user registration and an authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.

#### Getting Started
###### What You Might Need
* Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
* Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* Clone the repo using `git clone https://github.com/sharynneazhar/fs-nanodegree.git`

###### Secret Keys
You need to obtain your own secret keys from [Google API](https://console.developers.google.com/) and [Facebook Developer](https://developers.facebook.com/). A guide to obtaining a Google client ID can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGoty0VXgw). Once you register the app, you will be able to download the client secret JSON files required for the project. You may save the files under `/fs-nanodegree/P5-Restaurant-Menu/`. (Note: Udacity reviewers will be provided the necessary client IDs and secret keys under project submission notes)
