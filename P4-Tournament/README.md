# Tournament Results
A project from Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree Program

#### Project Description
You will develop a database schema to store the game matches between players. You will then write a Python module to rank the players and pair them up in matches in a tournament. You will learn how to architect and develop a database containing fully normalized data within multiple tables. Youâ€™ll then learn how to modify this data and query it to meet the demands of a variety of use cases.
